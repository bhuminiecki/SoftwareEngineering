# Retrospective

## Sprint nr 1

### Problems we've ran into:

- Leaving developement for the last moment
- Not dividing the tasks clearly
- Not everyone could run the project initially
- We've created code but didn't realise it didn't allign with DoD

### Solutions:

- Better time management
- Using Trello more
- We try not to miss internal deadlines
- We all use the same IDE
- We divide the workload more evenly
- We begin designing new functionality from DoDs and product registry
